Ultimately I want to assemble a CSV with a list of company names & GitHub org names, and tell the script to slowly run through it, getting all of the commit data, then parsing for gender.

Step 1: Assemble data for all companies

Step 2: Give gender scraper a directory to look in where CSVs are stored
